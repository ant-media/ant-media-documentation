## Releases

[https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/releases/](https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/releases/)

## Licenses

Ant Media Server has basically two types of licenses.

1.  Ant Media Server Community Edition is free to use.
2.  Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition has a paid license per instance/server. Paid license options are monthly, annually, and perpetual. You can get licenses from [antmedia.io](https://antmedia.io/) or you can use hourly/monthly/yearly licenses from Marketplaces in [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?x=0&y=0&searchTerms=Ant+Media+Server&page=1&ref_=nav_search_box), [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/antmedia.ant_media_server_enterprise?tab=Overview), [Digital Ocean](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/ant-media-server-enterprise-edition), [Alibaba](https://marketplace.alibabacloud.com/products/56712002/Ant_Media_Server_Enterprise_2_2_1-sgcmjj00025347.html), and [Linode](https://www.linode.com/marketplace/apps/ant-media/ant-media-community-edition/)

### Enterprise Cluster License

Enterprise Cluster License is similar features to the Enterprise License. The only difference is that Enterprise Cluster License supports many instances run simultaneously with the same license key. On the other hand, the Enterprise License key only supports one instance at a time.

If you're planning to have a large deployment for your Enterprise Cluster, please contact Sales at [contact@antmedia.io](mailto:contact@antmedia.io) in order to have some discounts.

### Free Enterprise License for Education and Tech Communities

Ant Media provides _free Enterprise Licenses_\* for the \*students, academics, and communities. To get the advantage of this opportunity, just send an email (from your institution or community e-mail address) to [contact@antmedia.io](mailto:contact@antmedia.io)

## Functional Architecture

![](@site/static/img/Simple_Architecture.png)

## Supported Environments

Ant Media Server runs on **Linux(Ubuntu)** and **MacOS**. it supports both x64 and ARM architecture. Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04 and CentOS 8 are officially supported. In addition, It's known that Ant Media Server is used on SUSE, Debian, WSL, and RHLE distributions as well.

## Extensions

### Object Recognition with TensorFlow

Ant Media Server can use a trained deep learning model to recognize objects in the live streams. This is a CPU-intensive process so if you enable this feature, the server's CPU consumption will increase.

Meanwhile, users can use any deep models to execute the live streams on the fly.

## Community

There is a user community available. You can ask or answer questions by joining the community at [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ant-media/discussions)

You can also ask your questions in [Discussions Q&A](https://github.com/orgs/ant-media/discussions/categories/q-a)

## Case Studies

You can find different case studies [here](https://antmedia.io/case-studies/) to see where and how Ant Media Server can help your business to grow.

## Blog posts

There are hundreds of blog posts written by the Ant Media team to provide guidance for the use of the Ant Media Server and you can find them [here](https://antmedia.io/blog/)
