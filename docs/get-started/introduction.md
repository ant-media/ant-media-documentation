Ant Media server provides a ready-to-use, highly scalable, real-time video streaming solution.  It supports both Ultra-Low Latency (WebRTC) and Low Latency (CMAF & HLS) live streaming.

Ant Media Server (AMS) can be deployed easily and quickly on-premise or on public cloud networks such as AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, Linode, and Alibaba Cloud.

There are two versions of Ant Media Server: Community Edition and Enterprise Edition. You can find a comparison table below.

Ant Media Server can be configured in cluster mode to dynamically scale horizontally and vertically to support thousands of viewers and broadcasters simultaneously in an automated and controlled way.

Playback of live streams is supported in any web browser and in addition to this, SDKs for iOS, Android, and JavaScript are provided freely to enable customers to expand their reach to a broader audience.

## Community Edition Releases

You can download Ant Media Server Community Edition from¬†[Github](https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/releases/)

## Licensing

Ant Media Server has two types of licenses.

1. Ant Media Server Community Edition is free to use, with Apache license.
2. Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition needs a paid license per instance/server. Paid license options are hourly, monthly, annually and perpetual and can purchase a license directly from [antmedia.io](https://antmedia.io). 

### Enterprise Edition cluster license

The Enterprise Edition cluster license has similar features to the standard Enterprise Edition license. The only difference is that the Enterprise cluster License supports many instances running simultaneously with the same license key. The standard Enterprise Edition license only supports one instance at a time.

If you're planning to have a large deployment for your Enterprise Cluster, please contact Sales at¬†[contact@antmedia.io](mailto:contact@antmedia.io)¬†to discuss discount options.

### Free Enterprise Edition license for educational and tech communities

Ant Media provides **free Enterprise Edition licenses**¬†for students, academics, and communities. To take advantage of this opportunity, just send an email from your institution or community e-mail address to¬†[contact@antmedia.io](mailto:contact@antmedia.io)

## Functional Architecture

**![](@site/static/img/image-1648754379709.png)**

## Supported Environments

Ant Media Server runs on¬†**Linux (Ubuntu and CentOS)**. It supports only x64 architecture, and deployment scripts are provided for Ubuntu (starting from 18.04) and CentOS 8. In addition, Ant Media Server can be successfully deployed on MacOS, SuSE, Debian, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions as well.

## Extensions

#### Object recognition with TensorFlow

Ant Media Server can use a trained deep learning model to recognize objects in live streams. This is a CPU-intensive process so if you enable this feature, the server's CPU consumption will increase.

Meanwhile, users can use any deep models to execute live streams on the fly.
