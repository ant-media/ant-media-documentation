# iOS SDK User Guide

Ant Media's WebRTC iOS SDK allows you to build your own iOS applications that can publish and play WebRTC broadcasts. It also supports screen sharing on iOS using a broadcast extension.

This guide is designed to be beginner-friendly and walks you through the following key steps:
- [Creating an iOS app project in Xcode](/guides/developer-sdk-and-api/sdk-integration/ios-sdk/xcode-project/)
- [Adding the WebRTC-iOS-SDK dependency](/guides/developer-sdk-and-api/sdk-integration/ios-sdk/ios-dependency/)
- [Publishing WebRTC live streams](/guides/developer-sdk-and-api/sdk-integration/ios-sdk/ios-webrtc-publish/)
- [Playing WebRTC live streams](/guides/developer-sdk-and-api/sdk-integration/ios-sdk/ios-webrtc-play/)
- [Screen Sharing using a broadcast extension](/guides/developer-sdk-and-api/sdk-integration/ios-sdk/ios-screen-share/)

In future updates, we will also explore video conferencing capabilities for iOS developers.
