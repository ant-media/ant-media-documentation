### Step 3: Verify the Published Stream

- Open the Ant Media Server web panel in a browser:(e.g., http://server_ip:5080) and view the stream there.

You can also quickly play the stream via an embedded player. For more details, check [this document](https://antmedia.io/docs/guides/playing-live-stream/embedded-web-player/).
