In order to test the publish sample, let's open `player.html`. Go to the definition of **websocketURL** variable and set your Ant Media Server WebSocket URL.

Before playing, make sure that there is a stream that is already publishing to the server with the same stream ID that you want to play. You can quickly publish a WebRTC stream using the sample page in the publish sample.

 - Open your browser and go to your HTTP server's address. Go to the `player.html` path.

 - Enter the stream ID that you want to play.
