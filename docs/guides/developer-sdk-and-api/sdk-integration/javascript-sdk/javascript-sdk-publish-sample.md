To verify whether the stream is published successfully or not,  open the web panel of your Ant Media Server and view the stream there.

You can also quickly play the stream via an embedded player. Check [this document](https://antmedia.io/docs/guides/playing-live-stream/embedded-web-player/) for more details.
