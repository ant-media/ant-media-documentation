Before playing, make sure that there is a stream that is already publishing to the server with the same streamId that you want to play. You can quickly publish a WebRTC stream using the sample page in the publish sample.

 - Open your favorite browser and go to your http server's address. Go to the player.html path.

 - Enter the stream Id which you want to play.
