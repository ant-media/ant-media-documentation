* Open the **/samples/play/android** folder and provide read, write, and execute permissions to the **gradlew** file.

```shell
chmod 750 gradlew
```

* Go to the **/samples/play** folder and run the below commands to run the **Play** sample React native app.

```shell
npm install
npm run android
```

* Before playing, make sure that there is a stream that is already published to the server with the same streamId in your **defaultStreamName** variable. You can quickly publish a WebRTC stream to the Ant Media Server via a sample page.

`https://your_domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE`

* Click the `Start Playing` button on the screen to play the stream that you are publishing on the server.
