1. Open the **/example/src/Play.tsx** file and update the **defaultStreamName** variable for streamId and the **webSocketUrl** variable with your server domain or IP address.

2. Open the **/examples/android** folder and provide read, write, and execute permissions to the **gradlew** file.

```shell
chmod 750 gradlew
```

3. Move to the **examples** folder, edit the below **index.js** file as below:

```bash
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
//import App from './src/App';
import App from './src/Play';
//import App from './src/Peer';
//import App from './src/Conference';
//import App from './src/Chat';
import { name as appName } from './app.json';
AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
```

4. Run the below commands to run the **Play** sample React native app.

```bash
npm install
npm run android
```

5. Before playing, make sure that a stream is already published to the server with the same stream ID as in your **defaultStreamName** variable. You can quickly publish a WebRTC stream via the sample page:

`https://your_domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE`

6. Click the **Start Playing** button on the screen to play the stream published on the server.
