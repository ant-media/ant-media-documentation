# Load testing

In this tutorial, we'll explain how to make a load testing on your Ant Media Server. The test environment has two parts: test server and SUT (system under test). We have two different setups for two different SUTs.

Preparation of SUT
------------------

### One instance setup

In this option, we have only one Ant Media Server instance as SUT.

    +-------------------+                  +----------------------+
    |                   |   streaming      |                      |
    |                   |   playing        |                      |
    |                   | `<-------------->` |                      |
    |    Test Server    |                  |   Ant Media Server   |
    |                   |                  |                      |
    |                   | `<-------------->` |                      |
    |                   |    rest          |                      |
    +-------------------+                  +----------------------+

### Cluster setup

Here we have a cluster structure as SUT which contains one origin and N edge servers.

                                           +--------------------+

Ant Media WebRTC test tool
--------------------------

You can download the WebRTC load test tool from your account at [antmedia.io](https://antmedia.io/). The test tool is listed with Enterprise Edition under Download section of your Subscription.

Ant Media WebRTC Test Tool is a Java project for testing Ant Media Server WebRTC capabilities and has the following features.

*   This tool is compatible with Ant Media Server signaling protocol.
*   It has two modes: publisher and player (-m flag determines the mode)
*   It has two options with UI or without UI (-u flag determines the UI on/off)
*   You can also save received (in player mode) video.
*   You can create a load with the -n flag.
