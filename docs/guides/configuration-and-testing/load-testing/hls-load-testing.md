This document outlines the steps to perform an HLS load test on your Ant Media Server using the provided script with the help of FFmpeg.

The script simulates a specified number of HLS viewers accessing a live stream.

## Prerequisites

- A server or virtual machine running Ubuntu 20.04 or later

- FFmpeg installed on the server

- The HLS load test script provided

### Step 1: Download the HLS Load Test Script

1. Open a terminal window on your Ubuntu server or virtual machine.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the HLS load test script.

3. Use the following command to download the `hls_players.sh` script and give it executable permission:

     ```bash
     sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ant-media/Scripts/master/load-testing/hls_players.sh && sudo chmod +x hls_players.sh
     ```

### Step 2: Running the HLS Load Test

1. Start publishing your live stream. For example, letâ€™s say it has the stream ID `stream1`.

2. Open a terminal window on your Ubuntu server or virtual machine and go to the directory where you downloaded the `hls_players.sh` script.

3. Run the following command to start the HLS load test:

     ```bash
     sudo ./hls_players.sh https://AMS-Domain:5443/LiveApp/streams/stream1.m3u8 100
     ```
     
  This command creates 100 HLS viewers for the stream ID stream1 in the LiveApp application of your Ant Media Server.

  Replace the URL with the actual URL of your live stream and 100 with the number of HLS viewers you want to simulate.

4. Wait for the test to complete.

5. To stop the HLS load test, use the following command:

     ```bash
     sudo pkill ffmpeg
     ```

Similarly, you can increase the number of simulated HLS viewers as needed.

## Conclusion

When the HLS load test runs, the script launches multiple FFmpeg processes to simulate the specified number of viewers.

* In the terminal, you will see FFmpeg logs showing that each viewer is pulling the .m3u8 stream.

* On the Ant Media Server dashboard, the Viewer Count for your stream will increase according to the number of simulated viewers.

For example, if you run the script with 100 viewers, the stream statistics should show around 100 active HLS viewers.

This confirms that the load test is running successfully and that your server is handling the expected viewer load.
