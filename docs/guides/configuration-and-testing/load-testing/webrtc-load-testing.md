# Load testing

In this tutorial, we'll explain how to do WebRTC load testing on your Ant Media Server. The test environment has two parts: the test server and the SUT (system under test). We have two different setups for two different SUTs.

## Preparation of SUT

### One instance setup

In this option, we have only one Ant Media Server instance as SUT.

```

    |                   |   playing        |                      |
    |                   | <--------------> |                      |
    |    Test Server    |                  |   Ant Media Server   |
    |                   |                  |                      |
    |                   | <--------------> |                      |
    |                   |    rest          |                      |
    +-------------------+                  +----------------------+
```

### Cluster setup

Here we have a cluster structure as SUT which contains one origin and N edge servers.

## Ant Media WebRTC test tool

You can download the WebRTC load test tool from your account at [antmedia.io](https://antmedia.io/). The test tool is listed for Enterprise Edition under the Download section of your account.

Ant Media WebRTC Test Tool is a Java project for testing Ant Media Server WebRTC capabilities and has the following features:.

* This tool is compatible with the Ant Media Server signaling protocol.
* It has two modes: publisher and player (-m flag determines the mode)
* It has two options: with UI or without UI (-u flag determines the UI on/off)
* You can also save received (in player mode) video.
* You can create a load with the `-n` flag.

## Running Ant Media WebRTC Test Tool

### Installation

```bash
apt-get install openjdk-11-jre -y
unzip webrtctest-release-*.zip
cd webrtctest/
```

This tool can be run from the terminal with the following options:.

```bash
#publishes output.mp4 to the server with default name myStream
./run.sh -f output.mp4 -m publisher -s 10.10.175.53 -p 5080 -n 1 -u false

#plays 100 viewers for default stream, myStream
./run.sh -m player -n 100 -s 10.10.175.53 -p 5080 -u false
```

If you are doing load testing on a cluster via a load balancer, and if your origin server is running behind port 443 and your Edge server behind port 5443, then the command should be as follows:.

```bash
./run.sh -f test.mp4 -m publisher -s server-domain-name -n 1 -p 443 -q true -u false

./run.sh -m player -i streamId -n 100 -s server-domain-name -p 5443 -q true -u false
```
