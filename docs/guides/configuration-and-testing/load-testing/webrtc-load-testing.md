# Load testing

In this tutorial, we explain how to perform WebRTC load testing on your Ant Media Server. The test environment has two parts: the test server and the SUT (system under test). There are two different setups depending on whether the SUT is a standalone server or a cluster.

## Preparation of SUT

### Standalone server setup

In this option, there is only one Ant Media Server instance as the SUT.

```
    +-------------------+                  +----------------------+
    |                   |   streaming      |                      |
    |                   |   playing        |                      |
    |                   | <--------------> |                      |
    |    Test Server    |                  |   Ant Media Server   |
    |                   |                  |                      |
    |                   | <--------------> |                      |
    |                   |    rest          |                      |
    +-------------------+                  +----------------------+
```
To set up the Ant Media Server, see the installation guide:(https://antmedia.io/docs/guides/installing-on-linux/installing-ams-on-linux/).

### Cluster setup

In this option, the SUT is a cluster with one origin server and N edge servers.

```

## Ant Media WebRTC test tool

You can download the WebRTC Load Test Tool from your account at [antmedia.io](https://antmedia.io/). The test tool is available under the Download section for Enterprise Edition users.

The Ant Media WebRTC Test Tool is a Java project for testing Ant Media Serverâ€™s WebRTC capabilities. It has the following features:

* Compatible with the Ant Media Server signaling protocol
* Two modes: publisher and player (controlled with the -m flag)
* Two options: with UI or without UI (controlled with the -u flag)
* Ability to save received video in player mode
* Ability to create load with the -n flag

## Running Ant Media WebRTC Test Tool

### Installation

Run the following commands to install Java and unpack the tool:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openjdk-17-jre -y
unzip webrtc-load-test-tool-*.zip
cd webrtc-load-test/
```
### Runningthe Test Tool

The tool can be run from the terminal with the following options:

```bash
#publishes output.mp4 to the server with default name myStream
./run.sh -f output.mp4 -m publisher -s 10.10.175.53 -p 5080 -n 1 -u false

#plays 100 viewers for default stream, myStream
./run.sh -m player -n 100 -s 10.10.175.53 -p 5080 -u false
```

If you are load testing on a cluster via a load balancer, and your origin server is running behind port 443 and your edge servers behind port 5443, the commands are as follows:

```bash
./run.sh -f test.mp4 -m publisher -s server-domain-name -n 1 -p 443 -q true -u false

./run.sh -m player -i streamId -n 100 -s server-domain-name -p 5443 -q true -u false
```

### Parameters

r    	 Publish Loop.  false        true or false
c    	 Codec          h264         h264 or VP8 
d    	 Data Channel.  false        true or false

```

:::imp
The MP4 file should contain H.264-encoded video and Opus-encoded audio.
:::

### Conclusion

Once you run the WebRTC Load Test Tool, you will see logs in the terminal showing the progress of publishers and players.

* In publisher mode, the logs confirm that your media file is being published to the Ant Media Server, along with details about the connection.

* In player mode, the logs show multiple WebRTC connections being established and video streams being received.

Below is an example of what successful test output looks like in the terminal.

This confirms that the load test is running correctly and that the desired number of connections have been created.
