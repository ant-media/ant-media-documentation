A content delivery or distribution network (CDN) is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal of a CDN is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end-users

## What is Amazon CloudFront?

Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up the distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the request is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay) to deliver content with the best possible performance.
