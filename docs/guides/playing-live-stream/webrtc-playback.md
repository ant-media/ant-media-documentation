WebRTC playback is only available in Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition (EE).

**Note:** For WebRTC playing, please ensure that UDP ports  `50000-60000`  are open on your server's firewall.

If client is behind a corporate firewall or have network restrictions, you can utilize TURN server to redirect WebRTC traffic. More details can be found [here](https://antmedia.io/docs/guides/advanced-usage/turn-and-stun-installation/coturn-quick-installation/).

Before playing a stream with WebRTC, make sure that stream is broadcasting on the server.
