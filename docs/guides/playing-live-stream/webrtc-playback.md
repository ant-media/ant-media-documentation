Ant Media Server (AMS) offers ultra-low latency WebRTC playback, enabling real-time streaming experiences.

### Prerequisites
- **Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition (EE):** WebRTC playback is supported only in the Enterprise Edition.
- **Open UDP Ports:** Ensure that UDP ports 50000‚Äì60000 are open on your server's firewall to facilitate WebRTC traffic.
- **Active Stream:** Verify that the stream is actively broadcasting on the server before attempting playback. Quick Link: [Learn How to Publish with WebRTC](https://antmedia.io/docs/guides/publish-live-stream/webrtc/)
- **TURN Server (Optional):** If viewers are behind corporate firewalls or experience restricted network conditions, consider routing WebRTC traffic through a TURN server [here](https://antmedia.io/docs/guides/advanced-usage/turn-instalation/coturn-quick-installation/). 

1. Visit ```https://AMS_domain_name:5443/live/player.html```.
2. If you're running Ant Media Server on your local computer, you can also visit ```http://localhost:5080/live/player.html```
3. Write the stream id in text box, ```stream1``` by default.
