# HLS Playing

HLS playback is available in both the Community and Enterprise Editions of Ant Media Server. Prior to initiating playback of a stream, ensure that the stream is actively broadcasting on the server.

> Quick Link: [Learn How to Publish Live Streams](/docs/category/publish-live-stream/)

## Enable HLS

Ensure that HLS muxing is enabled in your application settings. You can verify this by selecting the ```Create HLS Streaming```checkbox within the application's settings on the web management panel. 

HLS is automatically enabled by default.

### Enable HLS at the Broadcast Level

To enhance the HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) feature, you can now pass HLS parameters (`hlsTime`, `hlsListSize`, `hlsPlayListType`) while creating a live stream. This allows for more granular control over your HLS streams directly during the creation process.
-   `hlsTime`: Sets the target duration of each segment in seconds.
-   `hlsListSize`: Defines the number of segments in the playlist.
-   `hlsPlayListType`: Specifies the playlist type (`event` or `vod`).

Example:

Hereâ€™s an example of how to pass these parameters in a `POST` request to create a live stream with specific HLS settings:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Accept: Application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://<Your-Ant-Media-Server>/<App-Name>/rest/v2/broadcasts/create -d '{"streamId":"test1","name":"test1s","type":"liveStream","hlsParameters":{"hlsTime":"4","hlsListSize":"7","hlsPlayListType":"event"}}'
```
-   `hlsTime` is set to `4`, meaning each segment will be 4 seconds long.
-   `hlsListSize` is set to `7`, meaning the playlist will contain 7 segments.
-   `hlsPlayListType` is set to `event`, indicating that the playlist type is an event playlist.

### Play HLS Streams with Embedded Player

You can use the embedded player in `play.html` to play the streams with HLS. To use play.html, go to the below URL format.

```https://AMS-domain-name:5443/WebRTCAppEE/play.html```.

If you have Ant Media Server installed on your local machine, you may also go to

```http://localhost:5080/WebRTCAppEE/play.html```.

To play a HLS stream, provide ```streamId``` as the id and ```hls``` as the playOrder parameters in the URL shown below.
    
```https://AMS-domain-name:5443/WebRTCAppEE/play.html?id=test&playOrder=hls```

The HLS playback will start automatically when the stream is live.

To learn more about the embedded player, check [the document](https://antmedia.io/docs/guides/playing-live-stream/embedded-web-player/).

Autoplay is enabled by default in a player, but it may be disabled for certain policies in Chrome and Firefox. So you might need to click the player button to get it started. Check out the following links:

[Chrome policy](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes)

[Firefox policy](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/02/firefox-66-to-block-automatically-playing-audible-video-and-audio/)

### Play HLS Streams with React Player
To play HLS streams with [React Player](https://github.com/cookpete/react-player) component in React, configure the player like below:

```
<ReactPlayer
  url="https://{AMS-URL}:5443/{APP-NAME}/streams/{STREAM-ID}.m3u8"
  config={{
    file: {
      hlsOptions: { 
        xhrSetup: function(xhr) {
          xhr.withCredentials = true // send cookies
        }
      }
    }
  }}
/>
```
Enabling `xhr.withCredentials` to send cookies is essential for accurate HLS viewer counts. Without this configuration, the viewer count may not be correctly determined by the Ant Media Server. 

Special thanks to [@geneukum](https://github.com/geneukum) for this configuration contribution.


### Playing streams from SubFolders

When creating or updating a stream on Ant Media Server via the Rest API, you have the option to specify a subfolder for the broadcast. This allows HLS files to be generated within that designated folder.

This functionality ensures that when HLS files are being generated on the server side, they will be placed in the specified subfolder path within the `/usr/local/antmedia/webapps/{appName}/streams` directory. For instance, if you create a stream with the streamId `teststream` and a subfolder `mySubFolder` in the WebRTCAppEE application, then your HLS files `(.m3u8 and.ts)` will be generated under:

```/usr/local/antmedia/webapps/WebRTCAppEE/streams/mySubFolder``` directory.

Curl sample to create a broadcast with subFolder:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/rest/v2/broadcasts/create' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "streamId":"teststream",
    "subFolder": "mySubFolder"
}'
```

Alternatively, if you name subFolder as ```teststream/mySubFolder``` your HLS files will be generated under:

```/usr/local/antmedia/webapps/WebRTCAppEE/streams/teststream/mySubFolder``` directory.

Curl Sample:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/rest/v2/broadcasts/create' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "streamId":"teststream",
    "subFolder": "teststream/mySubFolder"
}'
```

Remember, if you try to HLS play a stream that has a subFolder defined, you need to pass ```subFolderName/streamId``` as an ID to the embedded player.

So if you created a stream with  ```"streamId":"teststream"``` and ```"subFolder":"mySubFolder"``` you should play it with:

```https://domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/play.html?id=mySubFolder/teststream&playOrder=hls```

If you created a stream with ```"streamId":"teststream"``` and ```"subFolder":"teststream/mySubFolder"``` you should play it with:

```https://domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/play.html?id=teststream/mySubFolder/teststream&playOrder=hls```

To observe how folders and files are generated, go to ```/usr/local/antmedia/webapps/{appName}/streams``` 
directory.

### Playing HLS stream directly via M3U8

Assume HLS muxing is enabled and a stream is published to Ant Media Server.

The default HLS (.m3u8) URL will be as follows:

```http(s)://AMS-domain-or-IP:Port/AppName/streams/StreamId.m3u8```

If adaptive bit rates are enabled in the application (Enterprise Edition), the HLS (.m3u8) URL will be as follows:

```http(s)://AMS-domain-or-IP:Port/AppName/streams/StreamId_adaptive.m3u8```

:::info
Beginning with version 2.4.1, the filename structure included the bitrate in the name. For example, 480p ABR is enabled on the server and you want to play it.
:::

In prior versions, the HLS filename was streamId_480p.m3u8, but now it is stream1_480p1000kbps.m3u8, as we enabled the same resolution with multiple bitrates.

If you would like to use the old structure, check the following
[post](https://github.com/orgs/ant-media/discussions/4984).

## Interactive HLS Streaming with ID3 Timed Metadata

Using `ID3` tags in HLS, you can insert any kind of timed metadata, such as overlaying some text or images in specific moments to show comments, emojis, ads, markers, etc. where `ID3` is a data stream.

The feature to use `ID3` tags was introduced in Ant Media Server version 2.7.0

### Enabling ID3 Tags

To use the `ID3`, it is first needed to enable the `ID3` tags for the application.

It can be enabled from the `Advanced` settings by making `"id3TagEnabled": true` located under the application settings on the Ant Media Server Web Panel.

![](@site/static/img/playing-live-streams/hls-playing/enabling-id3.png)

### Adding ID3 Text

To insert an ID3 tag into any stream, just call the [REST method](https://antmedia.io/rest/#/default/addID3Data) with your metadata and use that metadata in your player.

Below is a curl sample to use ID3 metadata

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://domain:5443/AppName/rest/v2/broadcasts/streamId/id3' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '"string"'
```

Check out this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq-a_tEXY4E&t=763s) where we discussed and demonstrated ID3 tags.

:::info
Currently, ID3 Tags does not work with Ant Media Server default player (play.html) so you can use this [Codepen sample](https://codepen.io/Burak-Kekec/pen/PoXYMyG) for the testing.

## Save HLS Records

HLS streaming is a more cost-effective and secure method of streaming than video-on-demand assets. Furthermore, you can also record your live streams with HLS.

To enable HLS recording for your live streams and store all the HLS files (.ts and .m3u8), just log in to your AMS Web Panel.

Navigate to Application Setting -> Advanced, and configure the setting below:


![Screenshot 2023-09-25 153916](https://github.com/ant-media/ant-media-documentation/assets/86982446/10ca309d-c40f-4e74-b006-3dbc23e0dea8)

By default, only a certain number of TS files corresponding to segments are retained in the streams directory at any given time. However, by configuring the HLS playlist type to ```event```, the server continuously generates TS files, allowing for permanent storage if desired.

```js
 "hlsPlayListType":"event",
```
    
To store HLS files permanently after the stream is ended:

```js
"deleteHLSFilesOnEnded":false
```
    
To prevent overwriting of old HLS files in case the same streamId is used again, use the `append_list` attribute in `hlsflags` property.

Imagine you've completed streaming with an ID `teststream` and your last generated TS file is ```teststream000001013.ts.``` Without adding ```append_list``` to the HLS flags, restarting the `teststream` will initiate TS file generation from 0, overwriting existing .ts files. 

However, by setting it to ```append_list``` the first generated .ts file will be named ```teststream000001014.ts``` ensuring that your .ts files remain intact without being overridden.

```js
"hlsflags":"+append_list",
```

If you don't want the TS files to be appended to the previous recording, you may also enable date and timestamp for HLS files by adding the following property:.

```js
 "addDateTimeToHlsFileName":true,
```

![](@site/static/img/hls_datetime.png)

After making the changes, you can scroll down and save the settings. Now, your streams will be recorded as HLS.

Additionally, it's also possible to push HLS files directly to a remote endpoint without generating them on the local server in real-time, or alternatively, upload them via the standard procedure to an S3 bucket once the stream has finished.

To upload HLS in real-time, check out this guide:
> Quick Link: [Uploading HLS Files](https://antmedia.io/docs/guides/recording-live-streams/s3-integration-http-forwarding/#uploading-hls-files-to-the-s3-bucket-in-real-time)

## HLS Play For a Given Time Interval

Using the HLS modifier, playing an HLS stream within specified time intervals is achievable in Ant Media Server.

:::info
The HLS modifier feature is included by default on the server side, starting with version 2.9.0 of Ant Media Server.
:::

You can include the ```startTime``` and ```endTime``` parameters in the query string of the m3u8 request to play the stream during that specific time frame.

```https://domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/streams/streamId.m3u8?start=1668454888&end=1668454999```

### Configuration for HLS Manifest Modifier

Set the below settings from application settings -> advanced settings through the web panel

```"hlsflags":"+program_date_time",``` to add program date time in m3u8 file.

```"hlsPlayListType":"event",``` to keep all ts files references in m3u8 file.

```"deleteHLSFilesOnEnded":false``` to keep all .ts files on the disk after the stream finishes.

### Usage of HLS Manifest Modifier Plugin

Request m3u8 by adding the `start` and `end` date and time in the Unix timestamp as below:

```https://domain:5443/AppName/streams/streamId.m3u8?start=1668454888&end=1668454999```

You can get the time stamp as per the ts file date and time via [Epoch Converter](https://www.epochconverter.com/).
