# S3 Upload Record Type

In previous documents under S3 recording, we learned about recording streams to various cloud storages.

By default, Ant Media Server records and uploads all file types (e.g., **HLS, MP4/WebM, PNG**) to the bucket.

For instance, if a user wants to stream using HLS and record in MP4 format without uploading HLS files to the bucket. This can be controlled using the following application property:.

```js
"uploadExtensionsToS3": 7
```
  
You can modify this property in the application's Advanced Settings in the web panel. By default, the value is 7, uploading all HLS, MP4/WebM, and PNG files when enabled.

This setting is a number where the digits represent whether an upload will be done or not. The least significant digit switches `MP4/WebM` files, the second switches `HLS` and the third switches `PNG`.

**Example:** `uploadExtensionsToS3=5` (101 in binary) means upload MP4/WebM and PNG but not HLS.

Possible values are as follows:

 - No upload: `js uploadExtensionsToS3=0`
 
 - Only MP4/WebM upload: `uploadExtensionsToS3=1`

 - HLS upload only: `uploadExtensionsToS3=2`

 - HLS and Mp4/WebM upload: `uploadExtensionsToS3=3`

 - PNG upload only: `uploadExtensionsToS3=4`

 - PNG and MP4/WebM upload: `uploadExtensionsToS3=5`

 - PNG and HLS upload: `uploadExtensionsToS3=6`

 - Upload everything: `uploadExtensionsToS3=7`


Other than MP4 and WebM, HLS recording can also be done. Check out the [HLS recording document](https://antmedia.io/docs/guides/playing-live-stream/hls-playing/#save-hls-records).
