Ant Media Server can ingest your streams with WebRTC to make sure that you deliver a real-time streaming experience with minimal latency. 

**Note:** For WebRTC publishing, please ensure that UDP ports
```50000-60000``` are open on your firewall.

For more information on changing the port range, see [here](https://github.com/orgs/ant-media/discussions/4944).

Steps for WebRTC publishing:

## Navigate to the publish page

In the Enterprise Edition, go to 
```https://your domain name:5443/WebRTCAppEE```or
```https://your domain name:5443/WebRTCApp``` in the Community Edition.

If you have Ant Media Server installed on your local machine, you can also go to ```http://localhost:5080/WebRTCAppEE``` in the Enterprise Edition or ```http://localhost:5080/WebRTCApp``` in the Community Edition.

## Input the stream id

The random stream Id is generated by default every time a page is opened, but you can enter your own. Then click the ```Start Publishing``` button. After pressing the button, the text ```Publishing``` should blink.

Congratulations! You're now using WebRTC to publish to Ant Media Server from your browser!

By clicking on Options on the sample page, you can also change the Max Video Bitrate and Audio/Video Source.
