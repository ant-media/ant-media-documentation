WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) offers ultra-low latency streaming, making it ideal for applications requiring real-time interaction, such as live events, online gaming, and virtual meetings. Unlike traditional protocols like RTMP or HLS, WebRTC enables direct peer-to-peer communication, reducing delays to approximately 0.5 seconds. This makes it a superior choice for scenarios where immediacy is crucial.

:::info
For WebRTC publishing, please ensure that UDP ports
`50000-60000` are open on your firewall or security groups.

For more information on changing the port range, see [here](https://github.com/orgs/ant-media/discussions/4944).

## WebRTC Publish Sample Page

Go to this URL for WebRTC publishing: ```https://your domain name:5443/live```

If you have Ant Media Server installed on your local machine, you can also go to ```http://localhost:5080/live``` to publish the WebRTC stream.

## Stream Publishing

- The random streamId is generated by default every time a page is opened, however you can enter your own streamId as well. 
- Then click the ```Start Publishing``` button. After pressing the button, the text ```Publishing``` should blink.
