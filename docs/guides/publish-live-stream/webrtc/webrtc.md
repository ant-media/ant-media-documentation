Ant Media Server can ingest your streams with WebRTC to make sure that you deliver a real-time streaming experience with minimal latency. 

:::info
For WebRTC publishing, please ensure that UDP ports
`50000-60000` are open on your firewall or security groups.

For more information on changing the port range, see [here](https://github.com/orgs/ant-media/discussions/4944).

## Steps for WebRTC publishing:

### Navigate to the publish page

Go to this URL for WebRTC publishing: ```https://your domain name:5443/live```

If you have Ant Media Server installed on your local machine, you can also go to ```http://localhost:5080/live``` to publish the WebRTC stream.

### Input the streamId

- The random streamId is generated by default every time a page is opened, but you can enter your own. 
- Then click the ```Start Publishing``` button. After pressing the button, the text ```Publishing``` should blink.
