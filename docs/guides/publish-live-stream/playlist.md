## What is Linear Live Streaming?

Linear Live Streaming is basically about scheduling your streams for a 7/24 live streaming and can be delivered with different methods. Live Streams and VoD streams can be used in your scheduled live streams which means Linear as well.

So, Linear Live Streams have some programs which have a start and end date streams in the program. Furthermore, Linear Live Streaming is a live event in which all viewers are watching the same live event at the same time. This means you don‚Äôt get any spoiler before viewing.

Live linear streaming is a ‚Äúpassive‚Äù video viewing experience, meaning viewers don‚Äôt ‚Äúsearch and click‚Äù (except to change the program). The experience of linear streaming is that video content comes to you and while you can change the channel, you don‚Äôt have to select an entire collection of videos to watch like you do with a playlist.
