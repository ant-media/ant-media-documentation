# Publish RTMP stream using Teradek

Teradek Vidiu Pro is fully compatible with Ant Media Server. Before starting, you need to create a live stream in Ant Media Server web panel. You can create a stream in any application as there are no differences between them by default. However, your RTMP URL changes depending on which one you choose. When you create a live stream, your RTMP URL will be in the following format. If you choose **live** application, the RTMP URL will be:

```rtmp://YOUR_SERVER_IP_OR_URL/live/YOUR_STREAM_ID```

Depending on which app you use, you will use parts of these URLs in Teradek's settings.

Let’s have a step-by-step look on how to use Teradek Vidiu Pro for streaming. Firstly, start by powering the Teradek Vidiu Pro.
