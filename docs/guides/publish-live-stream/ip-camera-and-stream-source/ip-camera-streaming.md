# IP Camera Streaming

Ant Media Server users can pull IP camera streams easily from the management panel. In other words, you don’t need to write any commands or use a terminal to be able to re-stream external sources.

In order for IP camera re-streaming, the camera should support the ONVIF standard. ONVIF makes it easy to manage IP cameras. All CRUD and PTZ operations are based on well-defined SOAP messages.

Their are two ways to pull the IP camera stream on AMS:

1. Using the ONVIF URL
2. Using the direct RTSP URL

Let’s have a look at how to pull a stream from an IP camera.

## Add IP Camera - ONVIF URL

- Go to the management panel, select **LiveApp** from applications, then click on **New Live Stream** and select **IP Camera**.

- Fill in the **Stream Name**, **Camera Username**, **Camera Password** and any custom **StreamId**. 

- You should add the ONVIF URL of the IP camera. Generally, it is in the following format: ```IP-ADDRESS-OF-IPCAMERA:ONVIF PORT```. 

- If you don't know the ONVIF URL, you can use the **Auto Discover** feature. If the IP camera and the server are on the same network, the Ant Media server can discover them automatically.

:::info
If you want to use a secured domain instead of an IP address, make sure to prepend with the `http(s)` e.g.

`https://dynamic.dns.net:443`
:::

## Add IP Camera - RTSP URL 

If the IP camera does not support the ONVIF, then a direct RTSP URL can also be used to pull the stream directly on the Ant Media Server.

:::info
If the IP Camera is added directly using the RTSP URL, then the CRUD and PTZ operations cannot be performed on it using the AMS APIs.
:::

In order to add an IP camera with an RTSP URL, follow these steps:

*   First, log in to the management panel. Click on 
**New Live Stream** > **Stream Source**. Define stream name,RTSP URL and stream Id.
*   AMS starts to pull the camera stream automatically
*   As the stream starts to pull, you can watch it from the AMS panel.

### RTSP Transport Type

In some cases, the RTSP camera does not start and shows the status as `preparing` on the dashboard. By default, the [**RTSP pull transport type**](https://antmedia.io/javadoc/io/antmedia/AppSettings.html#rtspPullTransportType) is set to pull the stream with both `TCP` and ⁣`UDP` but sometimes the camera only supports only TCP or UDP at a time, so you can change it with the application settings.

Under the application's Advanced settings, their is the below property:

```js
"rtspPullTransportType": "3",
```

- If it is 1, the stream can be pulled with both TCP.
- If it is 2, the stream can be pulled with UDP only.
- If it is 3, the stream can be pulled with both UDP and TCP.

:::info
If the camera is accessible via FFMPEG or VLC but still does not start pulling on the AMS, try changing this parameter.

## IP Camera Playback

If IP cameras are accessible and properly configured, Ant Media Server adds their streams as a live stream and begins to pull streams from them. The management panel displays its current status. To watch the stream, click the **Play button**.

The IP camera stream can be monitored with any output protocol, like `WebRTC`, `HLS`⁣, ⁣`DASH` and `LL-HLS`. Check out the [playback section](https://antmedia.io/docs/category/playing-live-streams/) for more details.

Check out the [recording documentation](https://antmedia.io/docs/category/recording-live-streams/) to record the IP camera streams. 

## Rest API to add IP Camera Stream

This [Rest API](https://antmedia.io/rest/#/default/createBroadcast) can be used to create the live stream.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://IP-address-or-domain:Port/App-Name/rest/v2/broadcasts/create?autoStart=false" -d '{
"type":"ipCamera","name":"test","streamId":"test","ipAddr":  "127.0.0.1:8080","username": "camera-username","password":"camera-password"}'
```
