# Conference Call Recording

Unlike regular broadcast streams, conference calls have multiple participants, each with a unique stream. Therefore, the regular recording mechanism cannot be used in conference calls. Instead of recording each participant's stream individually, we need a solution that allows us to merge all the streams and record the entire room.
