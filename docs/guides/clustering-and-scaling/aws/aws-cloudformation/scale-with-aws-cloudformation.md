-   **AntMediaEdgeCapacity:** How many Edge servers will be created.
-   **AntMediaEdgeCapacityMax:** Edge Server where Auto Scale will reach maximum
-   **AntMediaOriginCapacity:** How many Origin servers will be created.
-   **AntMediaOriginCapacityMax:** Origin Server where Auto Scale will reach maximum
-   **CPUPolicyTargetValue:** Average CPU utilization of the Auto Scaling group. When the server reaches 60% CPU utilization average, new servers will be added
-   **EdgeInstanceType:** Edge Instance Type

-   **Email:** Subscription Email
-   **KeyName:** An Amazon EC2 key pair name.If there is no value here, you must create an ssh key (EC2 > Key Pairs).
-   **LoadBalancerCertificateArn:** Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the certificate to associate with the load balancer. Please check this guide: [https://antmedia.io/ssl-from-aws-certificate-manager-for-domain-name/](https://antmedia.io/ssl-from-aws-certificate-manager-for-domain-name/)
-   **MongoDBInstanceType:** MongoDB Instance Type
-   **OriginInstanceType:** Origin Server Instance Type

**12.** You can access the URL addresses for LoadBalancer HTTP and HTTPS in the Outputs tab. If you define the CNAME record for the domain you have defined on Certificate Manager to the Load Balancer address below, you can access Ant Media Server without a certificate error on the domain you have defined.

**13.** When you type the URL of the Loadbalancer, Ant Media Dashboard will be opened as below

You can login with “JamesBond” and the first instances instance-id in your origin group. If you don’t know the instance-id, please ssh to your mongodb instance and write the below commands via terminal

ActionScript

```actionscript
$ mongo> use serverdb> db.User.find()
```

It gives you an output like this

`{ "_id" : ObjectId("5d31612a4c79142df7c71914"), "className" : "io.antmedia.rest.model.User", "email" : "JamesBond", "password" : "i-1234567890abcdef0", "userType" : "ADMIN" }`

Your password is the one in “password” field in the format “i-xxxxxxxx”

 **14.** When you click on the Cluster tab, you can see the servers in Cluster.

<h2> 🌍 AMS Scaling Simplified — CloudFormation at Work! ⚙️ </h2>
</div>

You’ve launched AMS on AWS with CloudFormation: **auto-scaling Edges and Origins**, **load balancing**, **secure certs**, and everything deployed as infrastructure code. As CPU ramps up, new instances spin up; when load drops, resources scale in — all without manual hustle.

Your cluster is now **agile, resilient, and built to scale with you** — from zero to many, effortlessly! 🚀
