# Sending Notifications to Web and Mobile Clients:

## Send Test Notification from Firebase Console

Once the Android app is set up, you can send a test push notification from the Firebase console to ensure everything is working properly.

- Go to Firebase Console and navigate to the Cloud Messaging tab.
- Click on "Send your first message."
- Input the title and body of the notification.
- Select your Android app and click "Send."

You should receive the notification on your device if everything is correctly configured.
