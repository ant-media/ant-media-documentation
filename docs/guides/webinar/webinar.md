# Circle Webinar Solution

**AMS Webinar Solution** is built on the same core technology as Ant Media Server’s **[Circle video conferencing tool](https://antmedia.io/docs/guides/conference/circle-video-conference-solution/)**, but extended to support large-scale webinar scenarios. While Circle provides interactive video conferencing for small to medium groups, Circle Webinars adds features such as audience scalability, presenter–attendee roles, and seamless integration with ultra-low latency streaming. This makes it ideal for online events, trainings, and broadcasts where a few presenters interact with a large number of participants.

## What is Webinar?

A **webinar** (web-based seminar) is an online event that allows one or more presenters to share video, audio, and content with a remote audience in real time. Webinars are widely used in various industries, including

-   **Education** – Online classes, virtual classrooms, interactive lectures.
    
-   **Corporate Training** – Employee training, workshops, onboarding sessions.
    
-   **Online Events** – Product launches, conferences, panel discussions, live Q&A sessions.
    
-   **Community & Nonprofit** – Awareness campaigns, public information sessions, knowledge sharing.
    
Webinars combine the reach of traditional live streaming with the interactivity of real-time communication, enabling direct engagement between presenters and participants.
