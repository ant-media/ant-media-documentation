To use the Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition [official Docker Hub image](https://hub.docker.com/r/antmedia/enterprise/tags), you can execute the following command, which will pull the latest version directly from Docker Hub and run the container.

```bash
docker run --restart=always -d --name antmedia --network=host -it antmedia/enterprise:latest
```

OR

```bash
docker run --restart=always -d --name antmedia -p 5080:5080 -it antmedia/enterprise:latest
```

Once the container is running, reach out to the AMS dashboard and start streaming as explained below.


**But in case you want to create your own AMS Docker image to run the container, follow the below procedure:**


## 1. Download Dockerfile

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ant-media/Scripts/master/docker/Dockerfile_Process -O Dockerfile
```

## 2. Build Docker Image

You can perform the build process by entering your license key or having the zip file.

1. Enter a license key as an argument as follows, and then the build process will start.

:::info
The license key is required in the case of Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition only.

By default, it will directly fetch the current latest version image.
:::

```bash
docker build --network=host -t antmediaserver --build-arg LicenseKey=<Your_License_Key> .
``` 

2. Download and save the Ant Media Server ZIP file in the same directory as the Dockerfile. Then run the docker build command from the command line.

#### Enterprise Edition:

You can get the AMS Enterprise Edition Zip file from your [Ant Media account](https://antmedia.io) after purchasing the license.

For example, if the zip file name is `ant-media-server-enterprise-2.14.0-20250513_1544.zip`

```bash
docker build --network=host -t antmediaserver --build-arg AntMediaServer=ant-media-server-enterprise-2.14.0-20250513_1544.zip .
``` 

#### Community Edition:

You can get the AMS Community Edition Zip file from the Ant Media Server [GitHub release page](https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/releases).

For example, if the zip file name is `ant-media-server-community-2.14.0.zip`

```bash
docker build --network=host -t antmediaserver --build-arg AntMediaServer=ant-media-server-community-2.14.0.zip .
``` 
    
## 3. Run Docker Container

Now we have a Docker image with Ant Media Server. Run the Docker container with the below command:

```bash
docker run --restart=always -d --name antmedia --network=host -it antmediaserver
```

:::info
By default, it uses the host network ports to reach but for example, in Mac OS, the‚Å£ `network=host` does not work so you can define the port as shown below.
:::

```bash
docker run --restart=always -d --name antmedia -p 5080:5080 -it antmediaserver
```

In the above example, we used only port 5080 for HTTP but for example, RTMP uses port 1935 so it needs to be added separately.

```bash
docker run --restart=always -d --name antmedia -p 5080:5080 -p 1935:1935 -it antmediaserver
```

Similarly, more ports can be allowed as per requirements.

## 4. Volume

**Optional:** If you would like to use persistent volume, you can use it as follows. In this way, volume keeps even if your container is destroyed.

```bash
docker volume create antmedia_volume
docker run -d --name antmedia --mount source=antmedia_volume,target=/usr/local/antmedia/ --network=host -it antmediaserver
```

## AMS Dashboard

After the Docker container starts, reach out to `http://localhost:5080` or `http://host-IP:5080` to access the Ant Media Server dashboard.
