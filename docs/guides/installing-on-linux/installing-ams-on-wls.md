# Installing Ant Media Server on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) provides a lightweight virtualized environment to run Linux distributions directly on Windows. This guide shows you how to install Ant Media Server (AMS) on WSL, which can be useful for local development, testing, and demos.

:::info **Important:** This guide assumes you are using **WSL2** and Ubuntu as your Linux distribution. For production setups, we strongly recommend using a dedicated Linux server or virtual machine.  

We also **do not cover** every installation step of AMS here â€” please follow our [Installing Ant Media Server on Linux](https://antmedia.io/docs/installation/) documentation for the complete process. This guide supplements that with WSL-specific steps.
:::

## 1. Installing WSL and Ubuntu

You can install WSL and Ubuntu using a single command in PowerShell (run as Administrator):

```bash
wsl --install
```
  

Once the installation completes and the system reboots, you'll be greeted with a Linux shell asking you to create a username and password.

## 2. Updating the Ubuntu Environment

After setting up Ubuntu, update the package lists and install system updates:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## 3. Installing Ant Media Server

Follow our official [Linux installation guide](https://antmedia.io/docs/guides/installing-on-linux/installing-ams-on-linux/) to install Ant Media Server inside the WSL environment.

Once AMS is installed, check its status:

```bash
sudo service antmedia status
```

## 4. Accessing the Web Dashboard

If you're running AMS on WSL2, it will typically be available at:

```bash
http://localhost:5080
```

You can access this from any browser on your Windows machine.

## 5. Publishing a Test Stream

We can now test publishing a hls stream from the browser with this url:

```bash
http://localhost:5080/LiveApp/
```

And play it with the following:

```bash
http://localhost:5080/LiveApp/play.html?id=test&playOrder=hls
```

To play WebRTC you need to enable ssl, for more info, check out:

## Notes and Considerations

- AMS performance on WSL may be limited compared to a native Linux server.
- Hardware-accelerated encoding might not be available in WSL.
- WSL is best suited for **development and testing**, not production.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you can't access AMS at `localhost:5080`, check if the WSL instance is running and that AMS is started.
- Make sure ports are not blocked by your firewall or antivirus.
