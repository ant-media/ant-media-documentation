# Enforce Stream Quality

Ant Media Server (AMS) has the ability to force stream quality. In this guide, you'll learn what it is, how it works, and how to benefit from the stream quality feature.

Viewers can enforce a resolution they would like to get. Keep in mind: if you request a quality with bitrate higher than the viewer‚Äôs bandwidth, you might see packet drops or pixelation.

## How does the adaptive bitrate work?

Ant Media Server measures the viewers' internet speed and sends the best quality according to the internet speed of the viewer.

Example:

* Assume that there are two bitrates on the server.
    * The first one is 360p and 800kbps.
    * The second one is 480p and 1000kbps.
 
* Assume that the viewer's internet speed is as follows:
    * Above 1000kbps: In this case, a resolution of 480p is sent.
    * Less than 800kbps: In this case, a resolution of 360p is sent.

The adaptive bitrate feature ensures viewers receive only which qualities the server is publishing.

You can learn more about the adaptive bitrate in the previous document.

## Enforce Quality in WebRTC

Once the stream starts playing, the viewer receives the `play_started` notification. 

In `WebRTCAdaptor`, call `getStreamInfo` with `webRTCAdaptor.getStreamInfo(streamId)`.

```js
else if (info == "play_started") 
{
    console.log("play started");
    webRTCAdaptor.getStreamInfo(streamId);
} 
else if (info == "play_finished") 
{
```

### Retrieve Stream Information

Calling `getStreamInfo` triggers a response from the server containing stream details like adaptive resolutions, audio bitrate, and video bitrate.

```js
else if (info == "streamInformation") {

				var streamResolutions = new Array();

				obj["streamInfo"].forEach(function(entry) {
					// This supports both VP8 and H264; resolution entries might appear duplicate.
					if(!streamResolutions.includes(entry["streamHeight"])){
						streamResolutions.push(entry["streamHeight"]);
					}
				});
```

After getting stream info, you can force a specific resolution using:

```js
webRTCAdaptor.forceStreamQuality("{your_stream_Id}",  {the_resolution_to_be_forced});
```

### Enforce Quality on Client Side

There is a working sample `player.html` below. When you choose a resolution, it will force the quality. You can select the resolution, as you can see from the screenshot below.

In the example above, **360p** resolution is selected.

## Enforce Stream Quality in AMS Web player (play.html)

AMS also allows enforcing quality in the Web Player (play.html), similar to `player.html`. Users can select a resolution, and the stream will be forced to that quality.

To learn more about AMS Web Player, check **[here](https://antmedia.io/docs/guides/playing-live-stream/embedded-web-player/)**.

Adjust the playOrder setting to choose among WebRTC, HLS, DASH, or LL-HLS. Users can then select quality similarly via the Web Player.

### Enforcing Quality for M3U8 HLS URL

Since some users access HLS by specifying a particular `.m3u8` URL, you can enforce stream quality by selecting the variant corresponding to that quality.‚Äù

For example, if your HLS playlist has multiple bitrates:

* adaptive.m3u8
    * 240p
    * 360p
    * 480p
    * 720p

Here is the HLS URL format for specific bitrate and resolution:

```
https://domain:port/AppName/streams/[streamid]_[quality].m3u8
```
For example:

```
https://domain:5443/live/streams/stream1_480p1000kbps.m3u8
```

This ensures the player loads only specified quality instead of relying on adaptive selection.

To learn more about HLS playback, check out **[here](https://antmedia.io/docs/guides/playing-live-stream/hls-playing/)**.


### Enforcing Quality for M3U8 Low Latency HLS URL

Check out **[here](https://antmedia.io/docs/guides/playing-live-stream/ll-hls/)** to learn more about the low-latency HLS.

Here is the LL-HLS URL format for specific bitrate and resolution:

```
https://domain:port/AppName/streams/ll-hls/streamId/resolution/streamId__lowlatency.m3u8
```

For example:

```
https://domain:5443/live/streams/ll-hls/stream1/480/stream1__lowlatency.m3u8
```

You‚Äôve enabled **Enforced Stream Quality**, meaning viewers can pick (or you can push) exact resolutions via WebRTC, HLS, DASH, or LL-HLS. No guesswork: **what‚Äôs requested is what‚Äôs played.**

Now your streams aren‚Äôt **just adaptive** ‚Äî they **follow the quality rules you set.** ‚úÖ
