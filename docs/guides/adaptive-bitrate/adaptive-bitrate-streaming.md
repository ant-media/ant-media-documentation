# Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR)

Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR) enables Ant Media Server to automatically adjust video quality based on each viewer's network speed and device performance. By dynamically switching resolut`ions and bitrates, ABR ensures a seamless streaming experience with minimal buffering ‚Äî whether your audience is on high-speed fiber or a weak mobile connection.

---

## üéØ Why Adaptive Bitrate Streaming Matters

Internet users have varying connection speeds, from fast broadband to congested mobile networks. Without ABR, viewers with limited bandwidth may suffer from long buffering times, playback interruptions, or inability to watch your streams at all.

With ABR:
- Viewers always get the best possible quality for their network.
- Automatic switching happens behind the scenes, improving engagement and reducing viewer drop-off.
- Smooth playback is ensured even during network fluctuations.

## How ABR Works in Ant Media Server

Ant Media Server supports ABR for both **WebRTC** and **HLS** streaming:

| Protocol | ABR Behavior |
|----------|--------------|
| **WebRTC** | Ant Media Server dynamically monitors viewer bandwidth and selects the optimal stream. |
| **HLS** | The player evaluates available bandwidth and requests the most suitable bitrate from the server. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Enable Adaptive Bitrate Streaming

### ‚úÖ Recommended: Use REST API (No Restart Required)

Modern ABR configuration is done directly through Ant Media Server‚Äôs REST API. This eliminates the need for manual file edits or server restarts.

### üîÑ Broadcast-Level ABR Configuration

Since **Ant Media Server 2.8.3**, you can configure ABR settings at the **broadcast level**. This means each stream can have its own customized ABR profiles, offering more granular control.

### üìå API Endpoint

> [Update Broadcast API Reference](https://antmedia.io/rest/#/BroadcastRestService/updateBroadcast)

### üìù Example Request

The following example sets ABR profiles for a stream with ID `stream1`:

```bash
curl --location --request PUT 'http://<SERVER_ADDRESS>:5080/WebRTCAppEE/rest/v2/broadcasts/stream1' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "encoderSettingsList": [
    {"videoBitrate": 500000, "forceEncode": true, "audioBitrate": 32000, "height": 240},
    {"videoBitrate": 2000000, "forceEncode": true, "audioBitrate": 128000, "height": 720},
    {"videoBitrate": 2500000, "forceEncode": true, "audioBitrate": 256000, "height": 1080}
  ]
}'
```

### üîî Notes:
- The `encoderSettingsList` array defines each ABR profile.
- Each profile consists of:
  - `height`: The vertical resolution (e.g., 240 = 240p).
  - `videoBitrate`: The target video bitrate in bits per second.
  - `audioBitrate`: The target audio bitrate in bits per second.
  - `forceEncode`: Ensures transcoding happens even if the incoming stream matches the target resolution.

- When you configure ABR via API:
  - Changes are **applied instantly**‚Äîno need to restart the server.
  - These settings **override application-level ABR** settings for this specific broadcast.

### üåê Full ABR Profile Template (240p to 2880p)

If you'd like to offer a full range of resolutions, you can pass a JSON array like the one below. This example includes standard resolutions from **240p** up to **2880p**:

```json
"[{\"videoBitrate\":8000000,\"forceEncode\":true,\"audioBitrate\":320000,\"height\":2880},{\"videoBitrate\":6000000,\"forceEncode\":true,\"audioBitrate\":256000,\"height\":2160},{\"videoBitrate\":2500000,\"forceEncode\":true,\"audioBitrate\":256000,\"height\":1080},{\"videoBitrate\":2000000,\"forceEncode\":true,\"audioBitrate\":128000,\"height\":720},{\"videoBitrate\":1800000,\"forceEncode\":true,\"audioBitrate\":96000,\"height\":640},{\"videoBitrate\":1500000,\"forceEncode\":true,\"audioBitrate\":96000,\"height\":540},{\"videoBitrate\":1000000,\"forceEncode\":true,\"audioBitrate\":96000,\"height\":480},{\"videoBitrate\":800000,\"forceEncode\":true,\"audioBitrate\":64000,\"height\":360},{\"videoBitrate\":500000,\"forceEncode\":true,\"audioBitrate\":32000,\"height\":240}]"
```

> **Tip:** When sending this JSON via an API call or external tool like curl or Postman, ensure that the JSON string is properly escaped as shown above.

## Stats-Based Adaptive Bitrate Switching

Starting with **Ant Media Server v2.6.0**, you can enable **Stats-Based ABR Switching** to automatically adjust stream quality based on real-time bandwidth statistics gathered during the session.

By default:
- `settings.statsBasedABREnabled = true`

This means that **WebRTC viewers** will automatically receive the best possible resolution according to their available bandwidth, without the need for manual stream switching.

### How does it work?

- The server continuously monitors the viewer's network stats.
- Based on this data, it automatically switches between available ABR profiles (e.g., from 720p to 480p) to ensure smooth playback.

---

## Original WebRTC Stream Behavior with ABR

There is an additional setting that influences how the original WebRTC stream is handled when ABR profiles are configured:

- `settings.useOriginalWebRTCEnabled`

### Behavior:
- **`true`:**
  - Both the original incoming WebRTC stream and all transcoded ABR profiles are available for playback.
  - Example: Incoming stream at 720p with ABR profiles for 480p and 240p ‚Üí viewers can select between **720p**, **480p**, and **240p**.
  
- **`false`:**
  - Only the ABR transcoded streams are available (original resolution is excluded from playback).
  - Example: Same as above ‚Üí viewers will only see **480p** and **240p**.

### Why does this matter?

- Enabling the original stream alongside ABR profiles provides maximum flexibility to the player.
- Disabling it can reduce bandwidth usage if you only want viewers to consume the optimized ABR renditions.

## Best Practices

- When using **Stats-Based ABR**, it‚Äôs recommended to:
  - Offer at least **2-3 ABR profiles** to provide fallback options for unstable networks.
  - Consider enabling **GPU acceleration** if you plan to transcode into multiple profiles (to reduce CPU load).
  - Regularly monitor your viewer bandwidth stats via Ant Media‚Äôs monitoring tools to fine-tune ABR settings.
