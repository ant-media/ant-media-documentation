# Installation

There are two ways to install Ant Media Server (AMS).

1. Manual installation to a remote server with a public IP address:
The installation process for manually installing Ant Media Server Community and Enterprise Editions are the same, please refer to the [Installation instructions](/guides/installing-on-linux/installing-ams-on-linux/)

2. Launch in one of the cloud marketplaces [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?x=0&y=0&searchTerms=Ant+Media+Server&page=1&ref_=nav_search_box), [Azure](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/antmedia.ant_media_server_enterprise?tab=Overview), [DigitalOcean](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/ant-media-server-enterprise-edition) (video tutorial above).

For detailed information about how to configure SSL for Ant Media Server, reference the [SSL Setup guide](/guides/installing-on-linux/setting-up-ssl/).

## Ultra-low latency publishing/playing

Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition provides 0.5 seconds end-to-end latency. So let's try ultra-low latency first.

### Publishing

- Visit the following page `https://your-domain-address.com:5443/WebRTCAppEE/`
- Let the browser access the camera and mic. Then click `Start Publishing`

## Playing and Publishing Options

Both default play and publish pages have some options to customise the experience, incuding a data channel for sending and receiving text messages.

Clicking on the "Options" button will reveal more than one way to publish a live stream.

 In this example, there is more than one video source and more than one audio source. The default is to enabled your camera for a live stream chat, but other options include publishing your screen or publish your screen with your camera. 

### Playing

Click the "Options" button to see the different play back options. If adaptive bitrate (ABR) is enabled, you will be able to force the required quality.
