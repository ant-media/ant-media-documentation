# Introduction to Ant Media Server

Ant Media Server is a ready-to-use, highly scalable, real-time video streaming solution. It supports Ultra-Low Latency (WebRTC), Low Latency Dash (CMAF), and HLS live streaming.

Ant Media Server (AMS) can be easily and quickly deployed on-premises or on public cloud networks like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean, Oracle, and Linode.

Ant Media Server is available in two versions: **Community Edition** and **Enterprise Edition**. A table of comparisons is provided below.

There are two installation options for Ant Media Server: standalone (a single server) and cluster (many connected servers).
When set up in cluster mode, Ant Media Server can dynamically scale both horizontally and vertically to support thousands of viewers and broadcasters at once in an automated and controlled manner.

In addition to supporting live stream playback in any web browser, the SDKs for iOS, Android, Flutter, React Native, Unity, and JavaScript are also freely available for users to increase their audience reach.

## Community Edition and Enterprise Edition Releases

 - You can download the Ant Media Server Community Edition from
   [Github](https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/releases/)
   directly.
 - You can download the Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition package from your
   [antmedia account](https://antmedia.io/my-account/) after purchasing the license.

## Licensing

Ant Media Server has two types of licenses.

 - Ant Media Server Community Edition is free to use with Apache
   license.
- Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition requires a paid license per instance/server. Paid license options include monthly, annual, and perpetual licenses, which can be purchased directly from [antmedia.io](https://antmedia.io).

### Enterprise Edition cluster license

The Enterprise Edition cluster license has similar features to the standard Enterprise Edition license. The only difference is that the Enterprise Cluster license supports many instances running simultaneously with the same license key. The standard Enterprise Edition license only supports one instance at a time.

If you're planning to have a large deployment for your Enterprise Cluster, please contact Sales at [contact@antmedia.io](mailto:contact@antmedia.io) to discuss discount options.

### Free Enterprise Edition license for educational and tech communities

Ant Media provides **free Enterprise Edition licenses** for students, academics, and communities. To take advantage of this opportunity, just send an email from your institution or community e-mail address to [contact@antmedia.io](mailto:contact@antmedia.io)

## Functional Architecture

**![](@site/static/img/image-1648754379709.png)**

## Supported Environments

Ant Media can be installed on Linux, specifically Ubuntu (18.04, 20.04, and 22.04), CentOS (8 and 9), Rocky Linux (8 and 9), and Alma Linux (8 and 9). It is compatible with both the x86-64 and Arm64 architectures.

To run AMS on a single instance, you'll need at least 4 vCPU dedicated compute optimized servers with 8 GB of RAM. In terms of smooth read-write performance, SSD disks are highly recommended.

There are several installation methods available, including deployment to a full VM, Docker, or Kubernetes.
