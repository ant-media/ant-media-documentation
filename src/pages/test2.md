This quick start guide lets you set up Ant Media Server (AMS) Enterprise and try ultra-low latency streaming in a few minutes of time. The installation procedure for Ant Media Server Community and Enterprise Editions are same so you can install The Community Edition by following these instructions as well.

There are 2 options to start Ant Media Server (AMS).

1.  Install to a remote server with a public IP address

In this document we'll show you the first option.
