# Record Streams To Google Cloud Storage

Google Cloud is another cloud provider that is preferred by many Ant Media Server users. You could integrate your Google Cloud cloud instance easily with S3 cloud storage. Letâ€™s see how it can be done with a few steps!

Firstly, you need to create a Bucket. Just click the Create button and fill in the blanks. You should choose the access level to be fine-grained.
