    "description": "A TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) server is a network component that facilitates communication between devices behind NAT (Network Address Translation). It relays data packets between clients, enabling them to establish peer-to-peer connections even when direct communication is not possible.
    TURN load balancing involves distributing traffic across multiple TURN servers to optimize performance and ensure reliable connectivity for WebRTC users.
    
    For many applications, leveraging the default Google STUN server suffices. However, in scenarios where peers are operating within private networks and utilizing WebRTC communication, using a TURN server is a must. If your WebRTC streaming isn't working despite having open ports, it's highly probable that you require a TURN server."
