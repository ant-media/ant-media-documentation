## Step 4: Play WebRTC Live Stream in iOS
- Playing a WebRTC live stream in your iOS application is easier once you've created the project and published the stream.
- Edit the `ViewController.swift` file with the below code snippet
```
import UIKit
import WebRTCiOSSDK

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet weak var videoView: UIView!
    var client:AntMediaClient =  AntMediaClient.init();
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        client.setRemoteView(remoteContainer: videoView)
        client.setWebSocketServerUrl(url: "wss://test.antmedia.io:5443/WebRTCAppEE/websocket");
        client.play(streamId: "stream123456")
    }
}
```

- Run your WebRTC iOS application to play the stream.
