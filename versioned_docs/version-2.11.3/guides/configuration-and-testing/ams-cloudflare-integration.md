You can seamlessly broadcast and play WebRTC, HLS, and DASH using Ant Media Server in conjunction with CloudFlare. Let's walk through the step-by-step process of achieving this:

# Step 1: CloudFlare Configuration

 - After logging into Cloudflare, navigate to SSL > TLS > Overview, and
   set the SSL/TLS encryption mode to "Full (strict)."

 - Click on Origin Server in the same menu, go to "Create Certificate,"
   and after configuring the domain settings, click on "Create."

 - Origin Certificate and Private Key will be generated; copy these two
   files to the server where you run Nginx.

 - Ensure that the A record in DNS settings is set to "Proxied"
   (enabled).

# Step 2: Nginx Configuration

 - Complete the installation of Nginx by following the instructions
   provided [in this
   link](https://antmedia.io/docs/guides/clustering-and-scaling/load-balancing/nginx-load-balancer/#nginx-installation).
   
 - Copy your certificate and private key to the `/etc/nginx/ssl/`
   directory:

```
mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl
cp -p origin.pem privkey.pem /etc/nginx/ssl/
```

 - Create a vhost configuration file:

```
vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/antmedia.conf
```
Edit and save the file with the following lines, customizing them with your information:

```
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/origin.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/privkey.pem;
    server_name antmedia.space;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_connect_timeout 7d;
        proxy_send_timeout 7d;
        proxy_read_timeout 7d;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
    }
}
```

 - Verify the correctness of the configuration:

```
nginx -t
```

 - Restart the Nginx service:

```
systemctl restart nginx
```

Finally, access the control panel.
