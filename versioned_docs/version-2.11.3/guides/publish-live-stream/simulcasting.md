## How to Add/Remove RTMP Endpoints?

There are two options for adding/removing RTMP endpoints.

One of them is Add/Remove RTMP Endpoint with Dashboard, as shown in the examples above. It is intended for the general purpose.

Another option is to use the REST API to Add/Remove RTMP Endpoints.

### REST API to add/remove RTMP endpoint

This option is for advanced users by making an API request to the rtmp-endpoint.

#### Add an RTMP endpoint

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://AMS-domain:5443/App-Name/rest/v2/broadcasts/streamId/rtmp-endpoint' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "rtmpUrl": "rtmp://endpoint-URL/StreamKey",
      }
```
After adding the endpoint, you will receive one random ```dataId``` that will be used to remove the added endpoint using the remove rtmp-endpoint Rest API described in next step.

```bash
{
"success":  true,
"message":  null,
"dataId":  "customqfjJGd",
"errorId":  0
} 
```
You can get more information in the following [REST API](https://antmedia.io/rest/#/BroadcastRestService/addEndpointV3).

#### Remove an RTMP endpoint

Now, that ```dataId``` will be used to remove the added RTMP Endpoint.
```bash
curl -X 'DELETE' \
  'https://AMS-domain:5443/App-Name/rest/v2/broadcasts/streamId/rtmp-endpoint?endpointServiceId=dataId-from-add-endpoint-response' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

You can get more information in the following [REST API](https://antmedia.io/rest/#/BroadcastRestService/removeEndpointV2).

**PS:** To use the Rest APIs, please add your IP address to the ```Enable IP Filter for RESTful API``` option in the application Settings.
