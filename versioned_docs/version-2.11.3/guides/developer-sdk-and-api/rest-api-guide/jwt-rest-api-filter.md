# JWT REST API Filter Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to use the JWT REST API Filter in Ant Media Server.

## Step 1: Introduction

Understand that by default, the JWT REST API Filter is disabled and the REST API IP Filter is enabled in Ant Media Server. The JWT Filter can be used when you consume the REST API from different endpoints. For more information about JWT, visit [jwt.io](https://jwt.io).

## Step 2: Enable JWT Filter

The first step is to enable the JWT REST API Filter in Ant Media Server. Go to the web panel, find the setting for JWT REST API Filter, and enable it. Also, enter the Secret key which will be used for encrypting with `HMAC-SHA256` in the JWT REST API Filter.

## Step 3: Generate a JWT Token

Next, generate a JWT token. For this example, let's assume our secret key is `zautXStXM9iW3aD3FuyPH0TdK4GHPmHq`. There are plenty of libraries available for JWT token creation, which can be found at [Libraries for JWT](https://jwt.io/libraries/). For this example, we'll use the [Debugger at JWT](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io).

Use the `HS256` algorithm and the secret key `zautXStXM9iW3aD3FuyPH0TdK4GHPmHq` to generate the token. This will be our JWT token to access the REST API:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ0b2tlbiIsImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMn0.OESIxgNsnD_JwByKTXcrw9Ov4GaOUZw66QxMfmudhKQ
```

## Step 4: Generate JWT Token with Expiration Time(Optional)

It is also possible to generate a JWT token with an expiration time. For this, you can use the `exp` option in JWT. The token's expiration time is a Unix timestamp, and the token will become invalid once it expires.

## Step 5: Use JWT Token for Accessing REST Filter API

To use the JWT token, simply add it to the `Authorization` header as shown below:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: {JWTToken}" "https://{domain:port}/{application}/rest/v2/broadcasts/create" -d '{"name":"streamName"}'
```

## Step 6: Enable JWKS (Optional)

If you want to use the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) feature, you need to have an OAuth server like auth0.com. You can also build your own OAuth server system with [Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/install). For JWKS configurations, add parameters to the `/usr/local/antmedia/webapps/<App-Name>/WEB-INF/red5-web.properties` file:

```
settings.jwtControlEnabled=true
settings.jwksURL=YOUR_JWKS_URL
```

**For example:**

```
settings.jwtControlEnabled=true
settings.jwksURL=https://antmedia.us.auth0.com
```

Ant Media Server using JWKS needs the public keys used by the signing party to validate signatures. A JWKS's structure looks like this: [https://antmedia.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json](https://antmedia.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json).

Once you're finished adding properties, restart the Ant Media Server instance.

```bash
sudo service antmedia restart
```
After these configurations are applied, you can start taking advantage of the JWKS feature in your structure, just like with JWT Filter.
