Before moving forward with using WebRTC React Native SDK, we highly recommend using the sample project to get started with your application. It's good to know the dependencies and how it works in general.

### Install @antmedia/react-native-ant-media Package

**```npm```**

```shell
npm i @antmedia/react-native-ant-media react-native-webrtc
```

**```yarn```**

```shell
yarn add @antmedia/react-native-ant-media react-native-webrtc
```

### initialize useAntMedia adaptor


```js

import { useAntMedia, rtc_view } from "@antmedia/react-native-ant-media";

const adaptor = useAntMedia({
  url: 'wss://<your_server_domain_>/<application_name>/websocket', // your web socket server URL
  mediaConstraints: {
    audio: true,
    video: {
      width: 640,
      height: 480,
      frameRate: 30,
      facingMode: "front",
    },
  },
  callback: (message, data) => {
    console.log("Callback message: ", message, "Data: ", data);
  },
  callbackError: (errorMessage, data) => {
    console.error("Error message: ", errorMessage, "Data: ", data);
  },
  peer_connection_config: {
    iceServers: [{ urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' }],
  },
  debug: true,
  onlyDataChannel: false, // for using only data channel not audio and video
});

```

### How to publish a stream

The method below is used to publish a stream.

```js    
adaptor.publish(streamName);
```
    
    

The method below is used to stop publish

```js 
adaptor.stop(streamName);
```

### How to use peer 2 peer

The method method is used to join a room.

```js
adaptor.join(streamName);
```
    
    

The method below is used to leave a room.

```js
adaptor.leave(streamName);
```

### How to use conference

The method below is used to join a room.

```js
adaptor.joinRoom(room);
```
    
    

The method below is used to leave a room.

```js
adaptor.leaveFromRoom(room);
```

### How to use the data channel

The method below is used to send messages.

```js
adaptor.sendData(streamId, message);
```

### How to render stream

To display a local or remote video stream, use the rtc_view component.

```js
rtc_view(stream, /*custom style*/{ width: 100, height: 100 });
```

### How to switch camera

You need to get video track to switch camera.

```js
let isFrontCam = true;

try {
	// Taken from above, we don't want to flip if we don't have another camera.
	if ( cameraCount < 2 ) { return; };

	const videoTrack = adaptor.localStream.current.getVideoTracks()[0];
	videoTrack._switchCamera();

	isFrontCam = !isFrontCam;
} catch( err ) {
	// Handle Error
};
```

### How to toggle the microphone

You can mute/unmute microphone by toggling the track enabled value. It can be applied to local microphone and remote audio tracks.

```js
let isMuted = false;

try {
	const audioTrack = await adaptor.localStream.current.getAudioTracks()[0];
	audioTrack.enabled = !audioTrack.enabled;

	isMuted = !isMuted;
} catch( err ) {
	// Handle Error
};
```

### How to change remote audio tracks volume level

```js
const audioTrack = remoteMediaStream.getAudioTracks()[0];
audioTrack._setVolume(0.5);
```
