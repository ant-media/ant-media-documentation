To build the publishing sample project, follow the below steps.

* Open the **/samples/publish/src/App.tsx** file and update the **defaultStreamName** variable for streamId and the **webSocketUrl** variable with your server domain or IP address.

* Open the **/samples/publish/android** folder and provide read, write, and execute permissions to the **gradlew** file.

```

* Move to the **/samples/publish** folder and run the below commands to run the **Publish** sample React native app.

```

* Click the `Start Publishing` button on the screen to publish the stream on the server.

* You can now go to the web panel of Ant Media Server (e.g., http://serverIP:5080) and watch the stream there. 

You can also quickly play the stream via an embedded player. Check [this document](https://antmedia.io/docs/guides/playing-live-stream/embedded-web-player/) for more details.
