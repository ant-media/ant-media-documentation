Ant Media Server is a streaming engine software that provides adaptive, ultra-low latency streaming by using WebRTC technology with ~0.5 seconds latency or low latency by using HLS or CMAF. Ant Media Server a.k.a. AMS is highly scalable both horizontally and vertically, running on-premises or on any cloud provider of your choice.

AMS help creating high-performing organizations by supporting them with their needs of low-latency streaming infrastructure. This way, we're solving the video streaming and delivery headache, a huge problem for companies seeking low latency, adaptive video streaming, by making it simple and on-demand.

Ant Media‚Äôs main product is the real-time streaming engine, called Ant Media Server. Currently, 8000+ Ant Media Server instances run in over 135+ countries. Apart from the flagship product, Ant Media Enterprise Edition, startups can also enjoy the open-source Community Edition, downloadable from this repo.
